Hey! We are working on a school project that would gather all the information about different coding languages to a single database, so you wouldn't have to use multiple different sites and sources for information. If we get the page in a working order, at the end we are planning to open source our project. Our plan is to import all existing databases that are publicly available and to make it a Wikipedia style site so anybody with an account can edit the page and update the information as needed.
